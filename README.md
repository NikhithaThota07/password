# Password Toggle Functionality with Image

This code snippet provides a simple way to implement a password toggle functionality on a website. It allows users to see or hide the characters they type in the password field.

# Features:

Toggles password visibility on clicking the eye icon.
Displays a closed eye icon when the password is hidden.
Displays an open eye icon when the password is revealed.

# Requirements:

Basic HTML knowledge
Basic JavaScript knowledge

# Instructions:

Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., password_toggle.html).
Ensure you have two image files named "closedeye.png" and "openeye.jpeg" in the same directory as your HTML file. These images represent the closed and open eye states, respectively.
Open the HTML file in a web browser to see the functionality.

# How it Works:

The code utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the functionality.

HTML: Defines the structure of the webpage, including the password input field and the eye icon image.
CSS: Styles the layout and appearance of the elements.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity by toggling the password field type (between "password" and "text") based on the eye icon click. It also updates the image source depending on the current password visibility state.
